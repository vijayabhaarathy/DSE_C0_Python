#1. Write a NumPy program to find the number of elements of an array, length of one array element in bytes and total bytes consumed by the elements.

import numpy as np
arr1=np.array([[1,2,3],[3,4,5]])

print(f"Size: {arr1.size}")
print(f"Sum: {arr1.sum()}")
print(f"Length: {arr1.itemsize}")
print(f"Total bytes: {arr1.nbytes}")
